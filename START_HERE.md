# 👋 START HERE

## Your Hackathon Project is Complete! 🎉

I've built the entire **STUPID** application based on your functional specification. Everything is ready to test and demo.

---

## 🚀 To Test the Application RIGHT NOW:

### 1️⃣ Get an OpenAI API Key (2 minutes)
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign in and click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

### 2️⃣ Create Environment File (30 seconds)
   Create a file called `.env.local` in the root folder with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
   ```

### 3️⃣ Run the App (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   
   Then open: http://localhost:3000

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **No Persistence**: Intentional—focuses on the learning process
2. **Frontend-Only**: Simplifies deployment and demo
3. **Kraft Paper Aesthetic**: Calm, notebook-inspired design
4. **Naive AI Personality**: Curious, not sarcastic
5. **Self-Assessment**: AI evaluates its own comprehension

---

## 🎯 Demo Tips

- Start with a simple concept (e.g., "Primary Colors")
- Show the learning note evolution
- Demonstrate multiple concepts and category tracking
- Emphasize the "learning by teaching" philosophy
- Point out the humor in the meme gallery

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **API Key Required**: You need OpenAI billing enabled (~$5 credit is plenty)
- **Cost**: ~$0.20-0.50 for testing, <$1 for full demo
- **Data Not Saved**: Refresh = reset (this is intentional!)
- **Desktop Optimized**: Best experience on larger screens

---

## 🚢 Deployment (Optional)

To deploy to Vercel:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Deploy!
